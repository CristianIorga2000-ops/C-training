Main thread creates threads.
Each thread throws a dice.
Main waits for all threads to throw (barrier is used), then calculates the winners(all threads who threw the biggest value).
Each thread waits for main to elect the winners(a very primitive binary semaphore is used), then moves on to yelling at you saying wether they have won or not.

Modifiable predefined values:
	NR_THREADS - number of created threads
	DICE_MAX - max value of dice (maybe they use one hundred D&D dices, who knows?)
	SLEEP_MAX - max amount of time (in seconds) that is needed for a thread to throw a dice	


This is a practical example of barrier usage.
