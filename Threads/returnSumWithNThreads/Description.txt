Main process creates n threads and calculates the first m prime numbers (n, m can be given as execution parameters/ arguments or read from input).

Each thread will have to calcualte the sum of a part of the array of prime numbers, then return that sum to the main thread. Main thread will sum all parts up and print the final sum.
