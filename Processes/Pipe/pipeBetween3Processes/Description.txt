We have a hardcoded array of integers.
Main creates to child processes, and proceeds to divide the work of summing all the numbers in the array between Main and the 2 children.
The children then communicate their sum to the parent trough simple (unnamed) pipes.
The parent sums all parts and prints the final sum.

Exit statuses are used to signal erros during execution.
Exit status:
	0 - ok
	1 - Child1 fork() error
	2 - Child2 fork() error
	3 - pipe1 init error
	4 - pipe2 init error
	5 - parent read from pipe1 error
	6 - parent read from pipe2 error
	7 - child2 write in pipe error
	9 - child1 write in pipe error
