Main creates n threads (N can be given as param/ input) that each consume a randomly chosen amount of  units of  fuel from a common fuel pool. 

Main also creates M fuel suppliers (M can be given as param/ input)  that supply the fuel pool with fuel a number of  times each (it will be automatically calculated such that each consuming thread will have enough fuel to consume). 

MODIFIABLE VALUES:
	SLEEP_TIME 
		sleep time in refillFuel routine
	REFILL_COUNT 
		how many times each refiller will refill
	int choices[]={...} 
		the possible values that a consumer can have for consumption
		any integer values can be added and deleted as will, as long as there is at least one

Conditional variables will be used for proper waiting and signaling.
