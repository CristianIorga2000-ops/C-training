Very basic example of semaphore usage.
You have a number of threads that act as users trying to log in. 
However, your server has a limited amount of users that can be online at one time.
A semaphor is used to mimic this phenomenon.

Modifiable predefined values:
	NR_THREADS - number of threads (users)
	SERVER_LIMIT - maximum number of users in server
