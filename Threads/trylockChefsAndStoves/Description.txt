Main creates n (read either as parameter/ execution argument or as input) 'chef' threads.
Each chef thread will attempt to use the cooking stoves to cook, consuming the available fuel of a cooking stove by a random amount.
If a stove is occupied, chefs will attempt to find another one to cook on.
This goes on until all stoves are depleted of fuel, in which case all chefs go home.

Modifiable predefined variables:
	STOVE_CAPACITY - how much fuel a stove has (measured burgers/ foot* ounce)
	NR_STOVES - how many stoves there are available
	MAX_CONSUMPTION - maximum amount of fuel a chef can consume in a cooking session
